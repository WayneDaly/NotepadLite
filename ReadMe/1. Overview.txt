Notepad Lite
============

First off the title may be temporary as I intent for this project to base decisions on votes.
If a contributor has proven themselves on the project they will be entitled to vote.

1. I started making this project because I felt that it would look great on a portfolio and 
    doesn't want to be a part of a open source project!
	

2. I am new to this so of course if you have more experience in project management, coding, design or anything
    you can think of then please share your experience with us.


3. Any person who contributes with have a place in the credits for your portfolio. So just do the best you can!


4. I consider notepad++ a great program to take idea's from but I intend to keep this program as a tool
   that will not intimidate users with no technical experience and stay away from coding tools.
