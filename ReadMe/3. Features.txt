1. Tabs (Working)
   
   By opening or creating a file the program automatically opens a new tab.
   Creating a new file sets the title as "File 1" for example and it increments.
   Opening a file will set the title as the name of the file.
   Tabs will have a close system on each individual tab.
   
2. Tool-bar (Planned)
   
   The tool-bar will be on the top of the screen and gives the user the ability to click icons that
   provide a short-cut to certain widely used commands such as save.   
   
3. Save & Load (Working/In-Dev)

   As of now we have New, Open and Save-as working. Save still needs to be done. 
   Save-as and open lets the user pick the directory.
   Save should be disabled unless save as is used for a particular file first.

4. Install (Idea)

   A vote needs to be held to decide should we let the program as a standalone jar file,
   a jar wrapped in a .exe or have the program installed on the users computer.
   
5. Manual (Planned)

   The program will have a integrated manual system to explain how the program works for new users.
